# Form Filler with Speech-to-Text and Multilingual Support

## Overview
This project is designed to fill out forms based on user audio input. Users can provide their information in any language, and the application will automatically convert it to English and fill in the form fields. The advanced AI model ensures that users don't have to follow specific placeholders; for example, if the field is for the city, the user can say "I live in Toronto," and the form will be correctly filled.

## Features
- **Speech-to-Text**: Converts user audio input into text.
- **Multilingual Support**: Automatically translates information from any language to English.
- **Intelligent Form Filling**: Understands natural language and fills in the form fields accurately, even if the user doesn't follow the exact placeholders.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy to use and intuitive interface for seamless user experience.
